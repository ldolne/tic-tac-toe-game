# Tic-Tac-Toe game README

Here's a link to the final product: [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://ldolne.github.io/tic-tac-toe-game/ "Tic-Tac-Toe Game").

## Project Description

This is a solo project: a simple Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS/Less and vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The game has only one page, divided into two sections: the game's parameters and the game grid.

## Project Chronology

The project took approximatively 1-2 days to complete.

### Release Notes

Only one version of this game is and will be released.

- 2021 June 22: first complete version of the game

## Project Technologies

To build this project, I used HTML5, CSS3, Less (first time using it) and vanilla JavaScript.

Two free fonts were use: Raleway (for texts) and Nico Moji (for x and o marks).

## License

None.

I learned how to create the game and refined my code thanks to Borna Šepić's tutorial on dev.to: [Pure and Simple - Tic Tac Toe with Javascript](https://dev.to/bornasepic/pure-and-simple-tic-tac-toe-with-javascript-4pgn "Pure and Simple - Tic Tac Toe with Javascript").
